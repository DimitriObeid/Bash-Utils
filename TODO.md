# **_LIST OF TASKS TO DO_**

## TODO :

Make the project's script's name displaying when all the modules are initialized

- **Hint** : It's in the **_BU.Main.ModConfig.Project.GetProjectFilePath_**

Correct the loop errors :

- Current file : Status.lib

Reworking on the "Check...()", "Is...()" and "Get...()" functions. Here is how they work :

- Is : Calls the needed "Check...()" function while passing to it a value defined in the same "Is...()" function.
- Check : Takes a parameter, which is the value we want to obtain from the call of the needed "Get...()" function.
- Get : Does not need an argument, as it automatically returns a value.

## Non-important features :
A converter from normal text (in latin script) to 1337 5P34K, with four different levels of coding :
	- base		: L33T 5P34K
	- light		: 1337 5p34k
	- normal	: 1337 5|*34|<
	- high		: £33‡ šρ3@ķ
	- very high	: |_ 33¯|¯ _/¯|°3/-\|<

The same idea, but in Fдuх счяilliс (faux cyrillic)

## Long term ideas :

Porting the library on these operating systems :

- Android (via Termux)
- FreeBSD | NetBSD | OpenBSD
- Haiku
- OSX
