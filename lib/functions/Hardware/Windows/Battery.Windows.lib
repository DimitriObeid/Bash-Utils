# SCRIPT'S DESCRIPTION :

# Functions used to process data and parameters about the PC's battery with the help of the WSL / Windows system's commands.


# ----------------------------
# SHELLCHECK GLOBAL DISABLER :

# Add a coma after each warning code to disable multiple warnings at one go.

# Do not uncomment the "shellcheck disable" line, or else the "$(shellcheck)" command will be executed during the script's execution, and will not detect any coding mistake during a debugging process.

# DO NOT ADD A COMA AFTER A SHELLCHECK CODE IF THERE'S NO OTHER SHELLCHECK CODE FOLLOWING IT, OR ELSE THE "$(shellcheck)" COMMAND WILL RETURN ERRORS DURING THE DEBUGGING PROCESS !!!

# IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANOTHER SHELLCHECK CODE, WRITE THIS CODE DIRECTLY AFTER THE COMMA, WITHOUT ADDING A BLANK SPACE AFTER IT !!!

# shellcheck disable=SC2154


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DO NOT EXECUTE THIS SCRIPT DIRECTLY, instead, just source it by calling the "${__BU_MAIN_FUNCTIONS_FILES_PATH}" array in the initializer file.
